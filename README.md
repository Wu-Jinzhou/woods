# Woods 🌲

> "I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived."
> — **Henry David Thoreau**

## About
**Woods** is a personal knowledge base designed to silence the noise of the internet.

The modern web experience encourages hoarding. We keep hundreds of browser tabs open in fear of losing information, yet we rarely return to them. Furthermore, according to the **Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve**, we lose about 50% of new information within an hour and over 70% by the next day.

Woods is designed to solve this entropy. It is a unified system to save your inputs (books, tabs, links), process your thoughts (journals, notes), and publish your insights, making sure you don't just consume content, but actually remember it.

*Built with intent.*
