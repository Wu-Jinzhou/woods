# Woods 🌲

> "I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived."
> — **Henry David Thoreau**

## About
**Woods** is a personal knowledge base designed to silence the noise of the internet.

The modern web experience encourages hoarding. We keep hundreds of browser tabs open in fear of losing information, yet we rarely return to them. Furthermore, according to the **Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve**, we lose about 50% of new information within an hour and over 70% by the next day.

Woods is designed to solve this entropy. It is a unified system to save your inputs (books, tabs, links), process your thoughts (journals, notes), and publish your insights—ensuring you don't just consume content, but actually remember it.

## Key Features

### 1. Capture & Organization
Stop the browser tab overload.
*   **Universal Capture:** Save books, browser tabs, and links instantly via the Chrome/Arc Extension or mobile app.
*   **Smart Grouping:** Organize saved items into custom collections (e.g., Reading List, Project Research, Inspiration) rather than messy folders.
*   **Annotation:** Highlight text and take notes directly on saved webpages (similar to Google Doc comments) to retain key insights.

### 2. Personal Dictionary
A dedicated database for the granular details that usually get lost.
*   **Word & Quote Bank:** Save new words, idioms, or evocative phrases you encounter while reading.
*   **AI Indexing:** The system automatically generates definitions, etymologies, and context for your saved terms, making them easy to search and review.

### 3. Writing & Journaling
A distraction-free environment for both private reflection and public work.
*   **Daily Journals:** A dedicated space for daily entries, gratitude logs, or private diaries.
*   **Articles & Essays:** Write serious long-form content with a clean, focused editor.
*   **Substack Integration:** Connect your account to draft and publish newsletters directly from the app.

### 4. AI Assistant
An intelligence layer that has access to your specific knowledge base.
*   **Contextual Search:** Ask the AI to find specific notes, quotes, or ideas you saved months ago.
*   **Therapeutic Chat:** The AI acts as a companion (like a therapist or a good friend) that knows what you go through every day, helping you process your thoughts and emotions.

### 5. Tasks & Ideas
*   **Daily Todos:** A minimalist task manager integrated into your daily view to keep you organized.
*   **Quick Jots:** A dedicated scratchpad for capturing random ideas and sparks of inspiration before they vanish.

### 6. Publishing
